# Updating MAC adresses database for Dipiscan

This is a simple Python script to update the oui.dat file used by Dipiscan for manufacturer identification based on MAC addresses.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- **requests** module (can be installed with **pip**)

## Usage

1. Simply run the script using Python to download the latest OUI data used by Dipiscan: '**python update_oui.py**'
The script will download the OUI data from the IEEE website, parse it, sort it alphabetically, and create a new fresh `oui.dat` file.
2.  Make a backup of the original oui.dat file in dipiscan folder and copy the one that was just created with the script.
3.  Restart Dipiscan to see the updated manufacturer information.
